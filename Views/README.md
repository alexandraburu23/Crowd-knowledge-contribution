In this directory, one can find the views of each main component of the database: Users, Articles, Categories, Chapters and Changes.

The main views are: Index, Show, Edit and New.

Some components don't have some of the views because that action is incorporated with another component.

The folder for Articles has different indexes for the order in which the articles appear on the page.
